64 libraries were sequenced. Resulting libraries were quality filtered.

Samples names and metadata are in the file RNA_sacredfir.csv. Columns in this file:

Tube_number: label of the tube sent to seq facility Sample_code: sample name we used in the lab and analyses with processed data. Name structure as follows: S=Healty (tolerant) or D=damaged C= sampled during high O3 contingency or S = sampled during middle O3 concentration (Semana Santa) * 15 = pool of leaves with growth 2015 and 2016 (1 and 2 years old), 17= leaves of growth 2017 (current year's growth)

Bioanalyzer_Name: name of the sample reported in the bioanalyzer report. Name structure as follows: DPVR## (Daniel Pi√±ero Vero Reyes, number of sample) _ * sample code

Library_Name: name of the sample submitted for library preparation. Same than Bioanalyzer_Name.

Sample_Name: name of the sequences as given by sequency facility. Notice it matches only first part of Library_Name

Condition: Phenotype of the sampled individual

Season: season of sampling

Year: year of growth of the leaves sampled in 2017. 2015_2016= pool of leaves with growth 2015 and 2016 (1 and 2 years old), 2017= leaves of growth 2017 (current year's growth)

Notice that Sample_name were generated by the sequencing facility. In a subsequent step Vero changed it to our Library_Name. You will have to do this step too.
