# **Role of endophytic fungi in the resistance of sacred fir (Abies religiosa) to air pollution**

This repository contains the data and the scripts used to in the present project.


**Aims**

1. To characterize the fungal communities present inside the leaves of healthy and damaged fir individuals 
2. To compare if there are differences in diversity and community composition related to air pollution. 
3. To search for fungal transcript in RNA-Seq transcriptomic data from healthy and damaged fir individuals to detect signals of differential expression and identify fungal genes involved in the resistance of tolerant individuals.


**Repository structure**

This repository contains the folders **bin**, **data**, **metadata** and **figures**.

* The folder **bin** contains the scripts divided in subfolders which contains the scripts for each step of the transcriptomic analysis. 
* The folder **data** contains the data used.
* The folder **metadata** contains the information about the samples.
* The folder **figures** contains the    results of the analysis organized in figures.
